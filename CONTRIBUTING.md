# Issues and labels

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Email-Dashboard/Email-Dashboard/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests. Our issue tracker utilizes several [labels](https://github.com/Email-Dashboard/Email-Dashboard/labels) to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent:

Labels  | Description
------------- | -------------
`bug`  | Something isn't working!
`duplicate` | This issue or pull request already exists!
`enhancement` | New feature or request
`good first issue` | Good for newcomers!
`help wanted` | Extra attention is needed!
`question` | Further information is requested!
`docs` | Improving or updating our documentation.
`wontfix` | This will not be worked on!
`invalid` | This doesn't seem right!

So, when you want to start contributing on this issue labels please don't forget rules of the discussions. Also when working on any issue on Github, it's a good practice to make branches that are specific to the issue you're currently working on. For instance, if you're working on an issue with a name like "NAME OF ISSUE #1234", from the master branch run the following code: `git checkout -b Issue#1234`. In doing so, you'll be making a branch that specifically identifies the issue at hand, and moves you right into it with the `checkout` flag. This keeps your main (master) repository clean and your personal workflow cruft out of sight when making a pull request. 

After you've forked and cloned our repo, you can find issues to work on by heading over to our [issues list](https://github.com/Email-Dashboard/Email-Dashboard/issues). We advise looking at the issues with the labels [help wanted](https://github.com/Email-Dashboard/Email-Dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [good first issue](https://github.com/Email-Dashboard/Email-Dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), as they will help you get familiar with the Email-Dashboard code.
